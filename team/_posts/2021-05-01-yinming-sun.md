Yinming joined the BDL in May 2021 as a postdoctoral scholar. Yinming is a biomedical engineer by training and have been working mainly on experimental studies involving concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG). Currently, he is working on understanding the neuronal mechanisms underlying cognitive function through neuroimaging data collected during naturalistic settings. Specifically, he hopes to gain insights into how macroscale neuroimaging findings, especially those found through topological data analysis, can be fitted with microscale models with realistic biophysical parameters.
