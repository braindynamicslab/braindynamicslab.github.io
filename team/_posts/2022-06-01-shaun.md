The current literature of neuroscience is lacking a unifying model of brain function. My goal is to use novel computational methods to improve our understanding of how different cognitive and emotional functions are hierarchically organized in the brain. My academic training in neuroscience started with my BSc (honors) in Neuroscience with Cognitive Science at the University of Sussex. Following that, I completed my PhD. in Physiology, Development and Neuroscience studying serotoninâ€™s role in anxiety, and a short postdoctoral neuroimaging project studying adolescent brain development at the University of Cambridge.
