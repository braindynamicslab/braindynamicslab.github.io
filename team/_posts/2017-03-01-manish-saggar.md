I am a computational neuroscientist who is trained in machine learning, neuroscience and psychiatry. The overarching goal of my research is to develop reliable computational methods that will allow for characterizing and modeling temporal dynamics of brain activity, without averaging data in either space or time. I firmly believe that the spatiotemporal richness in brain activity might hold the key to finding the person- and disorder-centric biomarkers. Currently, funded by a New Innovator Award (DP2; NIH) and a Career Development Award (K99/R00; NIMH), I am developing methods to model the temporal dynamics of brain activity in individuals with psychiatric disorders and healthy controls.

I received my bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Information Technology (Allahabad) and my Masters and PhD from the University of Texas at Austin, advised by [Risto Miikkulainen](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/risto/) and [Clifford Saron](http://mindbrain.ucdavis.edu/people/saron). Following my PhD, I did my Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Stanford University School of Medicine, mentored by [Allan Reiss](https://profiles.stanford.edu/allan-reiss).
