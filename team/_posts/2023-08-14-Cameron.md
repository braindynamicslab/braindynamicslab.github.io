Cameron received his BA in molecular cell biology with emphasis in biological chemistry from University of California, Berkeley.  Following his training in molecular cell biology, Cameron focused on applying computational methods to animal models of cardiovascular dysfunction, absence epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorder at the UCSF Cardiovascular Institute, and later, the Stanford Wu Tsai Neuroscience Institute.  Cameron aims to leverage machine learning and large-data tools to compare dynamical brain organization in clinical and patient populations.  Current research interests include developing new diagnostic criteria for neurodivergent populations with an emphasis on structural and functional brain imaging and developing targeted, non-medication treatments for neuro-psychiatric disorders.
