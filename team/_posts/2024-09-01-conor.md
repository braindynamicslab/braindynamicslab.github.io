Conor received his BS in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Toronto. While in Toronto, he performed research on predicting cancer types in the Quaid Morris Lab, previously belonging to the Vector Institute and now to the Sloan Kettering Institute. He moved on to Machine Learning work at Google Ads, where he developed state-of-the-art recommender systems. Having reignited his passion of Neuroscience, Conor left his position at Google to pursue research opportunities with both the Sean Wu Lab at Stanford Medicine as well as the Brain Dynamics Lab at the Stanford Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute. He is particularly interested in utilizing his machine learning experience for brain computer interfaces research.
