I was a Research Assistant in the Brain Dynamics Lab. I received my bacheler degree from UW-Madison ('15) in Psychology and Computer Sciences. I was introduced to neuroimaging through a post-baccalaureate at the UC-Davis Center for Neuroscience, where I worked in the Translational Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience lab investigating cognitive control and reward mechanisms in psychosis. After deciding clinical psychology was not the graduate school route for me, I sought opportunities to expand my computational and network analysis skill set to better prepare myself for neuroscience graduate programs. I am interested in complexity and the emergent properties of distributed neural activity and hope to study this in the context of executive function - particularly cognitive flexibility. I am interested in using neuroimaging data to investigate and (hopefully) create novel models of network activity.

In Fall 2018, I started graduate training in Yale University.
