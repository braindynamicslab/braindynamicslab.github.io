I am an applied mathematician trained in computational topology, geometry, and data analysis. At Stanford, I am working on developing new methods for analyzing and fingerprinting neuroimaging data and in obtaining meaningful clinical insights from such analysis.

Prior to Stanford, I completed my PhD in the Department of Mathematics at The Ohio State University under the supervision of Facundo MÃ©moli. My thesis was titled "Metric and Topological Approaches to Network Data Analysis".
