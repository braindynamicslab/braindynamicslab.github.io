I am a translational researcher at the interface of developmental cognitive neuropsychology and neurobiology. My research is aimed at understanding the basis of typical and atypical brain development. An overarching goal of my work is to understand when, how and why individuals with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders fall off the trajectory of typical brain development. I work in close collaboration with computational researchers and clinicians, serving as a bridge to translate cutting edge science to solve problems with great clinical need such as improving early diagnosis and identifying meaningful subtypes to facilitate personalized interventions. To address these aims, my work combines information from genetics, brain imaging and deep behavioral phenotyping using computational methods to understand complex, multidimensional phenotypes.

I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology from Temple University, my PhD in Developmental Psychology from the University of Southern California and I completed postdoctoral training in Cognitive Neuroscience at Stanford.
