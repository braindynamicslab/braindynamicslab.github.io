In March 2018, I joined Prof. Dimitri Van de Ville at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne as a member of the IVAN (Interactive and Visual Analysis of Networks) project. Prior to that I did a two-year post-doctoral research stay with Prof. Thomas Yeo at the Singapore Institute for Neurotechnology (SINAPSE). I did my PhD at the University of Liège, in Belgium, under the co-supervision of Prof. Rodolphe Sepulchre (U.Cambridge/U.Liège) and Prof. Steven Laureys (U.Liège). The thesis entitled 'Dynamical modelling from resting-state brain imaging' explores experimental questions such as the role of brain anatomy in the emergence of brain dynamics but also related methodological aspects linked to systems identification.

In the summer of 2019, I visited Brain Dynamics Lab at Stanford as a Visiting Scholar to examine statistical properties of TDA-based approaches on fMRI data.
