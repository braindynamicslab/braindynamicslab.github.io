Soren received his BS in Computer Science and Engineering from Santa Clara University. While working as a research assistant in the Brain and Memory Care Lab at SCU, he discovered his passion for biosignal processing and the application of deep learning techniques to electroencephalograms for decoding motor imagery. Now, Soren aims to apply deep learning and topological data analysis to spatiotemporal neuroimaging data to further understand dynamic brain organization with the goal of developing robust diagnostics for psychiatric disorders. His additional research interests include the investigation of electroencephalogram-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia with the intention of facilitating early detection and early intervention.
