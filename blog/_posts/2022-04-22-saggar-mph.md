### Quick Summary
Excited to share new work re: anxiety-cognition interplay in a cool dataset where anxiety was manipulated via a threat-of-shock paradigm and cognition via Methylphenidate (MPH). Joint work with [@brunojenlynn](https://twitter.com/brunojenlynn), [@LMBClaudino](https://twitter.com/LMBClaudino), Claudie Gaillard, and Monique Ernst

### Methods
Using a TDA-based Mapper approach and a computational framework, we examined how cognitive enhancement (under MPH) might alter brain activity patterns in the face of induced anxiety and increased cognitive (working memory; WM) load.

### Results
Both approaches yielded converging evidence of WM load-appropriate engagement of neural resources under MPH (i.e., different neural engagement for 3- vs 1-back). This load-based engagement was linked to higher performance in the WM task during high load and anxiety conditions.
