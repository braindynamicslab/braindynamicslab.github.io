aims: Creativity is widely recognized as an essential skill for entrepreneurial success and adaptation to daily-life demands. However, we know little about the neural changes associated with creative capacity enhancement. Here, we studied i) whether creativity can be enhanced using targetted training and ii) the associated changes in brain dynamics.

### Aims

Creativity is widely recognized as an essential skill for entrepreneurial success and adaptation to daily-life demands. However, we know little about the neural changes associated with creative capacity. We are actively involved in doing a series of studies to better understand:

- how creativity is manifested in the brain

- can we enhance creativity using design-thinking based training

- how the neural activity changes with creative capacity enhancement


### Highlights

- We found that creativity can be enhanced using targetted d.school based training (2 hrs/wk for 5 wks)
- We developed a novel game-like fMRI paradigm to study creative capacity using the social-game of Pictionary
- Longitudinal analysis revealed reduced prefrontal engagement was associated with enhanced improvisational creativity
- Heightened creative capacity was also associated with increased functional connectivity between cerebral-cerebellar regions (esp. prefrontal-cerebellum)
