### Aims
By carefully studying the spatiotemporal dynamical patterns of communications between mitochondria, we aim to ultimately quantify energetic disturbances years before they manifest on a scan or in blood work into disease. 


### Highlights
- We recently examined the association between multiple features of mitochondrial health and stress-related behaviors in mice with diverse behavioral phenotypes
- Multi-slice network analysis applied to our brain-wide mitochondrial dataset identified three large-scale networks of brain regions with shared mitochondrial signatures. 
- Mito-based networks also overlap with regional gene co-expression and structural connectivity, thereby providing convergent multimodal evidence of mitochondrial functional organization anchored in gene, brain and behavior.
