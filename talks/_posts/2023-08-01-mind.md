abstract: Here, Manish discussed different studies of finding the neural correlates of human-human interaction. The talk focuses on three main areas of research - dyadic, triadic, and internal interactions. In dyadic interaction, we examined simple motor coordination tasks using fNIRS imaging and found differences based on sex and video game experience. In the triadic interaction, we synchronized three fMRI scanners to study collaborative drawing tasks, observing brain activity patterns and their relation to team creativity. We used topological data analysis (TDA) to analyze brain activity across individuals, finding differences in collaborative dynamics. Manish also discussed potential future research directions, including interaction with non-humans, brain stimulation, and neurodiversity.

In the triadic interaction, we synchronized three fMRI scanners to study collaborative drawing tasks, observing brain activity patterns and their relation to team creativity. We used topological data analysis (TDA) to analyze brain activity across individuals, finding differences in collaborative dynamics.
