# Abstract
In this talk Manish discusses the challenges in diagnosing mental health disorders compared to medical conditions with biological markers. He emphasizes the need for personalized approaches to brain imaging, as most studies involve group-level analysis. He shares the concept of "n=1" neuroimaging, aiming to capture individual brain dynamics. To achieve this, he uses Topological Data Analysis to understand the shape of brain dynamics as a whole and mentions its potential in improving diagnostic accuracy for conditions like ADHD and depression. He also highlights the importance of mechanistic insights and computational models to better characterize brain activity in healthy and patient populations.
