abstract: The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) hosted a two-day workshop on Advanced Statistical Methods and Dynamic Data Visualizations for Mental Health Studies. On Day 1, June 28, 2021, researchers shared their research on advances in statistical methods and applications. On Day 2, June 30, 2021, researchers (including Manish) shared their work in visualizing dynamic and interactive data. The main goals for this workshop were to (a) address the role of statistical methods in identifying meaningful effects in large neuro-behavioral samples, administrative data, or social media sources; and (b) showcase advanced methods for dynamic and interactive data visualization and identify potential use cases and gaps for these new dynamic data visualization tools.

# Abstract
The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) hosted a two-day workshop on Advanced Statistical Methods and Dynamic Data Visualizations for Mental Health Studies. On Day 1, June 28, 2021, researchers shared their research on advances in statistical methods and applications. On Day 2, June 30, 2021, researchers (including Manish) shared their work in visualizing dynamic and interactive data. The main goals for this workshop were to (a) address the role of statistical methods in identifying meaningful effects in large neuro-behavioral samples, administrative data, or social media sources; and (b) showcase advanced methods for dynamic and interactive data visualization and identify potential use cases and gaps for these new dynamic data visualization tools.
