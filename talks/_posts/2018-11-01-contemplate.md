abstract: This talk presents existing and new research from the emerging interdisciplinary field of contemplative neuroscience. The goal of this talk is to share current understanding about how training in contemplative practices (e.g. meditation) affects the brain and behavior. Some of the remaining questions and new directions for research also will be discussed. Manish is a computational neuroscientist and directs the Brain Dynamics Lab at Stanford. The overarching goal of his lab is to develop computational methods that would allow for extracting personalized insights about the brain’s dynamical organization in healthy and patient populations. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin, where he worked on developing one of the first biophysical network models for understanding how intensive meditation training changes brain dynamics. He is a meditator for more than 20 years and loves to talk about meditation and the brain.
