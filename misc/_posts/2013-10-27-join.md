We have immediate multiple openings for postdoc and research engineer/scientist positions. Please contact Dr. Manish Saggar (saggar@stanford.edu) directly. See below more details for the open positions

## Open position 1: Research engineer/Data scientist
<strong> Description </strong>: We are seeking a research engineer who will contribute to the development and maintenance of our tool boxes and processing pipelines. This person will interface with neuroimaging researchers, clinicians and computational researchers to develop and scale up our current data processing pipelines. This will require creating robust frontend and backend monitoring systems, configuring databases and Docker/Singularity containers, and developing pipelines and online interfaces for data collection, analysis, curation, and distribution. This position provides the opportunity for the applicant to participate in state-of-the-art data processing pipeline development within a multi-disciplinary team, whose goal is to develop computational methods for anchoring psychiatric diagnosis into spatiotemporal features of the brain.
