## Open position: Postdoctoral Scholar
<strong> Description </strong>: We are seeking a postdoctoral scholar with expertise in applying computational methods to clinical datasets (e.g., patients with mental health disorders). Strong emphasis on writing abilities. This person will interface with neuroimaging researchers, clinicians and computational researchers to apply computational methods to large scale clinical datasets (e.g., ABCD study dataset). Responsible for the implementation, analysis, and write-up of resting-state and task-based fMRI studies to understand individual differences in brain dynamics across psychiatric diagnoses. This position provides the opportunity for the applicant to learn state-of-the-art data processing and analysis pipelines within a multi-disciplinary team, whose goal is to develop computational methods for anchoring psychiatric diagnosis into spatiotemporal features of the brain.

<strong> Qualifications: </strong>
- highly motivated individuals who have demonstrated academic excellence, including publications in first-class journals and conferences.
- have a PhD (or equivalent) in Neuroscience, Psychology or a related field.
- expertise in statistical methods for medical image analysis
- expertise in fMRI data analysis (e.g., using FSL) and processing (e.g., Matlab)
- expertise in academic writing
- experience with large scale consortium data is a plus

<strong> To apply: </strong> Please send
- cover letter that includes the names and contacts for three references
- short statement of research interests
- current CV
- links to 2-3 published articles
