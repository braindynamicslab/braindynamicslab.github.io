The lab is now close to capacity, but we're still taking applications from qualified applicants.  We place particular emphasis on computational neuroscience, applied mathematics, psychiatry, and network science, and especially their intersection. We are committed to improving diversity in the computational sciences. Applicants of diverse backgrounds are particularly encouraged to apply.
