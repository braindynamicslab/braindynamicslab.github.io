We have immediate multiple openings for postdoc and research engineer/scientist positions. Please contact <strong> Dr. Manish Saggar (saggar<span style="display:none">obfuscate</span>@staford.edu) </strong> for any questions and for applications. See below more details for the open positions.

<hr>

## Open position 1: Research engineer/Data scientist
<strong> Description </strong>: We are seeking a research engineer who will contribute to the development and maintenance of our tool boxes and processing pipelines. This person will interface with neuroimaging researchers, clinicians and computational researchers to develop and scale up our current data processing pipelines. This will require creating robust frontend and backend monitoring systems, configuring databases and Docker/Singularity containers, and developing pipelines and online interfaces for data collection, analysis, curation, and distribution. This position provides the opportunity for the applicant to participate in state-of-the-art data processing pipeline development within a multi-disciplinary team, whose goal is to develop computational methods for anchoring psychiatric diagnosis into spatiotemporal features of the brain.

<strong> Qualifications: </strong>
- Bachelor or Masterâ€™s in computer science or related field.
- familiarity with shell scripting (like bash)
- excellent coding skills in Python and/or Matlab
- experience in software (or pipeline) development preferred
- hands-on experience with high performance computing (e.g., SLURM), fMRI data analysis pipelines (e.g., fMRIPrep) are preferred

<strong> To apply: </strong> Please send
- cover letter that includes the names and contacts for three references
- short statement of research interests
- current CV
- code samples or links to published/distributed code

## Open position 2: Postdoctoral Scholar
<strong> Description </strong>: We are seeking a postdoctoral scholar with expertise in applying computational methods to clinical datasets (e.g., patients with mental health disorders). Strong emphasis on writing abilities. This person will interface with neuroimaging researchers, clinicians and computational researchers to apply computational methods to large scale clinical datasets (e.g., ABCD study dataset). Responsible for the implementation, analysis, and write-up of resting-state and task-based fMRI studies to understand individual differences in brain dynamics across psychiatric diagnoses. This position provides the opportunity for the applicant to learn state-of-the-art data processing and analysis pipelines within a multi-disciplinary team, whose goal is to develop computational methods for anchoring psychiatric diagnosis into spatiotemporal features of the brain.

<strong> Qualifications: </strong>
- highly motivated individuals who have demonstrated academic excellence, including publications in first-class journals and conferences.
- have a PhD (or equivalent) in Neuroscience, Psychology or a related field.
- expertise in statistical methods for medical image analysis
- expertise in fMRI data analysis (e.g., using FSL) and processing (e.g., Matlab)
- expertise in academic writing
- experience with large scale consortium data is a plus

<strong> To apply: </strong> Please send
- cover letter that includes the names and contacts for three references
- short statement of research interests
- current CV
- links to 2-3 published articles
