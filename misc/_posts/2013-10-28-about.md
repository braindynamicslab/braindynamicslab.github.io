## Purpose

As a computational neuropsychiatry lab, we are dedicated to developing computational methods for a better understanding of individual differences in brain functioning in healthy and patient populations. 

### Projects
1. Using Topological Data Analysis and Network Science to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics in brain activity for developing person- and disorder-centric biomarkers [more](../../projects/saggar-tda-mapper-cme/)

2. Using novel neuorimaging paradigms to understand the role of brain dynamics in enhancing creative capacity at the individual level and in teams [more](../../projects/saggar-creativity)

3. Using biophysical network modeling to develop personalized neuromodulation prescriptions [more](../../projects/bio-physical-modeling)

### Funding
We are grateful for the following funding agencies for supporting our research.
