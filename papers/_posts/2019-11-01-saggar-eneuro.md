# Abstract
To accurately detect, track progression of, and develop novel treatments for mental illnesses, a diagnostic
framework is needed that is grounded in biological features. Here, we present the case for utilizing personalized
neuroimaging, computational modeling, standardized computing, and ecologically valid neuroimaging to anchor
psychiatric nosology in biology.

# Significance Statement
There is a growing recognition that the boundaries of human neuroimaging data acquisition and analysis
must be pushed to ground psychiatric diagnosis in biology. For successful clinical translations, we outline
several proposals across the four identified domains of human neuroimaging, namely, (1) reliability of
findings; (2) effective clinical translation at the individual subject level; (3) capturing mechanistic insights;
and (4) enhancing ecological validity of lab findings. Advances across these domains will be necessary for
further progress in psychiatric neuroimaging.
