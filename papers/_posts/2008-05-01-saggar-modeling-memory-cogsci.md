# Abstract

In a decision making task repeated encounters of a visual
stimulus attribute to improved performance in identification
and classification of that stimulus. This process is termed as
repetition priming. Recent studies have proposed that
response learning (RL), where previous decision gets
associated with that item, accounts for a significant portion of
performance gains observed in repetition priming. However,
RL is unable to explain intact priming in amnesic patient
population and residual priming in healthy population after
the decision cue was switched. Furthermore, it is still unclear
whether RL is dependent on the well structured knowledge
and object representations. In this paper two-fold approach is
taken to fully address the aforementioned issues. First, to test
the boundaries of RL and its dependence on knowledge
structures, a new repetition priming experiment using 2-D
novel objects is presented in healthy population. Experimental
results indicated that novel objects result in short-term
priming, and presenting the object multiple times did not
further facilitate reduction in response time. This pattern does
not fit prevailing theories of repetition priming, including RL.
A new perceptual memory-based association mechanism is
thereby required. Second, to formalize and test such a
mechanism, a computational model is developed. The model
was further extended to formulate priming using known
objects, thereby providing explanation for residual priming in
case of cue-inversion in healthy population and intact priming
in amnesic patient population. Altogether this paper presents
the missing link, perceptual memory-based association
mechanism, to fully capture all the memory processes
involved in decision making.
