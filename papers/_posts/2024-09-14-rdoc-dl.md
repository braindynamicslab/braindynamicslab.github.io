# Abstract
Recent work has shown that deep learning is a powerful tool for predicting brain activation patterns evoked through various tasks using resting state features. We replicate and improve upon this recent work to introduce two models, BrainSERF and BrainSurfGCN, that perform at least as well as the state-of-the-art while greatly reducing memory and computational footprints. Our performance analysis observed that low predictability was associated with a possible lack of task engagement derived from behavioral performance. Furthermore, a deficiency in model performance was also observed for closely matched task contrasts, likely due to high individual variability confirmed by low test-retest reliability. Overall, we successfully replicate recently developed deep learning architecture and provide scalable models for further research.
