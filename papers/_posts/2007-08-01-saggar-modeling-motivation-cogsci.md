# Abstract

This paper presents a computational model of how motivation
influences learning, elaborating on the empirical study of
Markman, Baldwin and Maddox (2005). In a decision
criterion learning task with unequal payoffs, the subjects were
more likely to maximize the reward when their motivation
was in line with the reward structure (i.e. when they were in a
regulatory fit), whereas they were more likely to maximize
accuracy when their motivation did not match the reward
structure (i.e. when they were in a regulatory mismatch). The
model accurately replicates this pattern of results, and also
accounts for the individual subject's behavior. In addition, the
model makes the novel prediction that regulatory-fit subjects
who are near the reward threshold will shift their strategy
toward maximizing accuracy, whereas regulatory-mismatch
subjects who are far from the reward threshold will shift their
strategy toward maximizing reward. When the original data
was reanalyzed, this model-driven prediction was confirmed.
These results constitute a first computational step towards
understanding how motivation influences learning and
cognition.
