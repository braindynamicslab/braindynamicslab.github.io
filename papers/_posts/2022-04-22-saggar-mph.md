# Abstract
The reciprocal interplay between anxiety and cognition is well documented. Anxiety negatively impacts cognition, while cognitive engagement can down-regulate anxiety. The brain mechanisms and dynamics underlying such interplay are not fully understood. To study this question, we experimentally and orthogonally manipulated anxiety (using a threat of shock paradigm) and cognition (using methylphenidate; MPH). The effects of these manipulations on the brain and behavior were evaluated in 50 healthy participants (25 MPH, 25 placebo), using an n-back working memory fMRI task (with low and high load conditions). Behaviorally, improved response accuracy was observed as a main effect of the drug across all conditions. We employed two approaches to understand the neural mechanisms underlying MPH-based cognitive enhancement in safe and threat conditions. First, we performed a hypothesis-driven computational analysis using a mathematical framework to examine how MPH putatively affects cognitive enhancement in the face of induced anxiety across two levels of cognitive load. Second, we performed an exploratory data analysis using Topological Data Analysis (TDA)-based Mapper to examine changes in spatiotemporal brain activity across the entire cortex. Both approaches provided converging evidence that MPH facilitated greater differential engagement of neural resources (brain activity) across low and high working memory load conditions. Furthermore, load-based differential management of neural resources reflects enhanced efficiency that is most powerful during higher load and induced anxiety conditions. Overall, our results provide novel insights regarding brain mechanisms that facilitate cognitive enhancement under MPH and, in future research, may be used to help mitigate anxiety-related cognitive underperformance.
