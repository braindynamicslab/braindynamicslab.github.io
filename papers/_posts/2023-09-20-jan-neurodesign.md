# Abstract
This chapter outlines the recent developments, such as neuroscience on design, design neurocognition, and NeuroDesign, in the intersection of neuroscience and design. This intersection of diverse disciplines, including psychology, neurophysiology, engineering, interaction design, and architecture, provides various opportunities and challenges to advance areas, such as design thinking, neurotechnology, embodied artificial intelligence (AI), and human-centered AI. We outline some of the opportunities and challenges with several examples, such as methodological and technological developments, necessary to develop this promising pan-disciplinary field. We emphasize the importance of educating researchers (i.e., NeuroDesign Researchers) and practitioners (neurodesigner/engineers) to advance this intersection toward a new area that could be greater than the sum of its parts.
